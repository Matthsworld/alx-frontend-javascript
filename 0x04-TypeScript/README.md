# **TypeScript Project: ALX Frontend JavaScript**

This repository contains a series of TypeScript tasks designed to teach advanced concepts and practical use cases of TypeScript, including strong 
typing, namespaces, modules, ambient declarations, and more. The project is part of the **ALX Frontend JavaScript** curriculum.

---

## **Project Structure**

The project is divided into tasks, each covering a specific TypeScript feature or concept:


---

## **Tasks Overview**

### **Task 0: Basic Setup**
- Set up TypeScript in a project.
- Configure `tsconfig.json` for type-checking and compilation.
- Create basic type annotations for variables and functions.

### **Task 1: Interfaces and Advanced Typing**
- Use interfaces to define complex object types.
- Implement functions using interfaces as arguments and return types.

### **Task 2: Tuples and Destructuring**
- Work with tuples to handle fixed-length arrays with specific types.
- Use destructuring for cleaner and more readable code.

### **Task 3: Ambient Declarations**
- Write ambient declarations (`*.d.ts` files) to describe the shape of JavaScript libraries.
- Use these declarations for IntelliSense and type safety in TypeScript.

### **Task 4: Namespace & Declaration Merging**
- Define and use namespaces to organize code.
- Merge declarations to extend existing types or interfaces.

### **Task 5: Brand Convention & Nominal Typing**
- Enforce nominal typing using brand properties.
- Use TypeScript to prevent accidental interchange of similar types.
